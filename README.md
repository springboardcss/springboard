# Springboard CSS

Springboard is a highly responsive CSS library designed to be the starting point of your next site.

## Concept

Springboard relies hevily on the hard work done by the Modularscale Sass and Picnic teams. It is meant to provide a baseline set of CSS rules for the project. For the most part styles have been applied to html elements, so everyth.ing can be overriden with your own CSS classes. Think normalize.css with some opinionated styles.
